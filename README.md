# CovidTwitterBot
The objective of this project is to scrape tweets using twitter’s api and reply to them automatically about corona status of the mention location of the tweet by scraping covid data from a website.


Our twitter bot will also tweet corona status of the country regularly everyday automatically.



Conclusion & Future Scope
As of now we’ve implemented tweets based on just states of india but
we further plan to broaden the horizon of search by adding data from all
the districts of india as well .
